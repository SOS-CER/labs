# CSC 217 Lab 11 Implement and Test `FacultySchedule`
{% include iconHeader.html type="implementation,unitTest" %}
`FacultySchedule` represents the  list of `Course`s that a `Faculty` has been assigned to teach by the `Registrar`.  A colleague has implemented the `FacultySchedule` and `FacultyScheduleTest` classes and shared them with you.  You will integrate them into your system and ensure that they work correctly with no regressions and no changes to the code.


## Create `FacultySchedule`
Create `FacultySchedule` in the `edu.ncsu.csc216.pack_scheduler.user.schedule` package of the `src/` source folder.  Copy in the [code for `FacultySchedule` provided by your colleague](files/FacultySchedule.java).


## Create `FacultyScheduleTest`
Create `FacultyScheduleTest` in the `edu.ncsu.csc216.pack_scheduler.user.schedule` package of the `test/` source folder.  Copy in the [code for `FacultyScheduleTest` provided by your colleague](files/FacultyScheduleTest.java).

There are several files that are used to help you with testing.  While you likely already have them, they are provided below if needed.

  * [starter_course_records.txt](files/starter_course_records.txt)
  * [course_records.txt](files/course_records.txt)
  

## Testing `FacultySchedule`
`FacultyScheduleTest` won't compile yet.  There are a couple of methods in `Faculty` that are needed for the test.  That's the next step!
