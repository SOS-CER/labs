# CSC 217 Lab 11 Update `RegistrationManager`
{% include iconHeader.html type="implementation,unitTest" %}
`Registrar` requires functionality in `RegistrationManager` for assigning a `Faculty` to a `Course`, removing a `Faculty` from a `Course`, and resetting a `Faculty`'s `FacultySchedule`.


## Implement `RegistrationManager.addFacultyToCourse(Course, Faculty)`
If the `currentUser` isn't `null` and is the `Registrar`, the `Faculty`'s `FacultySchedule` should be updated with the given `Course`.  Any exceptions should be propagated to the GUI.


## Implement `RegistrationManager.removeFacultyFromCourse(Course, Faculty)`
If the `currentUser` isn't `null` and is the `Registrar`, the `Faculty`'s `FacultySchedule` should be updated by removing the given `Course`.  Any exceptions should be propagated to the GUI.



## Implement `RegistrationManager.resetFacultySchedule(Faculty)`
If the `currentUser` isn't `null` and is the `Registrar`, the `Faculty`'s `FacultySchedule` should be reset.  Any exceptions should be propagated to the GUI.


## Update `RegistrationManagerTest`
Add test cases to ensure the new functionality is working correctly and that you have at least 80% statement coverage.
    

## Pass all Tests
Run all unit tests and ensure that they are all passing and that the teaching staff unit tests are also all passing before moving on.
