# CSC 217 Lab 09 Evaluate Runtime Efficiency
{% include iconHeader.html type="implementation" %}
Creating specialized data structures means that we can gain efficiencies in our add and remove operations.  Let's explore the runtime complexities of each of our *current* stack and queue implementations.


## Runtime Efficiencies
Consider the underlying data structure and determine the runtime efficiency of the following methods:

  * push()/enqueue()
  * pop()/dequeue()
  * isEmpty()
  * size()
  
Fill out the [Runtime Efficiency Google Form](https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFwP_39IRO3n9LqtmXgkqRUGZUBS9RwQhmkuL_oIlINvKytw/viewform) with your answers!
