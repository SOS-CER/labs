# CSC 217 Lab 06 Integrate into `Course`
{% include iconHeader.html type="implementation" %}
Now that the `CourseNameValidator` is complete, the `Course` class should use it to validate course names at construction.  


## Integrate `CourseNameValidator` into `Course`
Follow the [provided design](06-lab-design) to integrate `CourseNameValidator` into the `Course` class.

## Update Tests!
With the new `CourseNameValidator` functionality, and no longer allowing any spaces in course names, you'll need to update the tests for `Course` and other classes in your `PackScheduler` system.

You can use the [updated `course_records.txt` file](files/course_records.txt) to test your code. The changes should only require removing the space from between the leading prefix and the ending number.
