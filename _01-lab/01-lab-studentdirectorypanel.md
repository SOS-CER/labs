You've been provided `StudentDirectoryPanel` as the graphical user interface for the `StudentDirectory` portion of `PackScheduler`.  `StudentDirectoryPanel` was designed so that it may be used in future parts of `PackScheduler` with minimal updates.  Right now it stands alone so that you can test `StudentDirectory`.  It also provides a few of the error messages for alternative flows in the [requirements](01-lab-requirements).

At this point in the semester we do not expect you to fully understand the provided GUI code, but we encourage you to explore the structure of the GUI and see where the GUI interacts with `StudentDirectory`.
