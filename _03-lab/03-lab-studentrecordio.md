description: Use `SortedList` in `StudentRecordIO`
navigation: on
pagegroup: 03-lab
---

Now that there is a library for maintaining a list in sorted order, the `SortedList` class should be used instead of `ArrayList`.  Update your `StudentRecordIO` to use `SortedList`.

{% include iconHeader.html type="implementation, unitTest" %}


## Refactor `readStudentRecords()` to use `SortedList`
Refactor the method header for `readStudentRecords()` by selecting the method name, right clicking, and selecting **Refactor > Change Method Signature.**  Change the return type from `ArrayList<Student>` to `SortedList<Student>`.  Click **OK**.

There will be an error about a type mismatch on the return type, but that can be fixed after the refactoring.  Additionally, several other classes will no longer compile after the change.  You'll fix the compilation errors through the rest of this section.  You may need to import `SortedList`.

Once the refactoring is complete, change the local variable `students` to the `SortedList<Student>` type rather than the `ArrayList<Student>` type.  `StudentRecordIO` should compile.


## Refactor `StudentRecordIOTest`
Refactor the compilation errors in `StudentRecordIOTest` by changing any reference to `ArrayList` to a `SortedList` in the tests for `readStudentRecords()`.


## Refactor `writeStudentRecords()` to use `SortedList`
Refactor the method header for `writeStudentRecords()` by selecting the method name, right clicking, and selecting **Refactor > Change Method Signature.**  Select the `ArrayList<Student>` parameter from the list and click **Edit.**  Change the type from `ArrayList<Student>` to `SortedList<Student>`.  Click **OK** and **OK** again.

Once the refactoring is complete, fix any compilation errors in `writeStudentRecords()`.


## Refactor `StudentRecordIOTest`
Refactor the compilation errors in `StudentRecordIOTest` by changing any reference to `ArrayList` to a `SortedList` in the tests for `writeStudentRecords()`.


## Update your Tests
Run your tests.  There is likely at least one failure because of the new sorted order functionality.  Update your tests for the new use case.

Run your tests instrumented for coverage.  Make sure that your tests execute at least 80% of the statements in `StudentRecordIO`.  

If the `testWriteStudentRecordsNoPermissions()` fails locally, it won't record the coverage.  Push to GitHub and run on Jenkins to verify coverage of throwing that exception. 
    

## Javadoc your Code
Make sure that you update the Javadoc for `StudentRecordIO` and `StudentRecordIOTest`. 

Run [CheckStyle](https://pages.github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc216/guided-projects/gp1/gp1-static-analysis#checkstyle) to ensure that your Javadoc has all elements.

## Check Jenkins
Make sure that you have a job and it's pulling from GitHub.

Your project will have a red ball.  That is because you will have compiler errors in `StudentDirectory` and you have not yet completed some of the refactorings that the teaching staff tests will expect.  Therefore, the teaching staff tests are unable to compile against your code.
