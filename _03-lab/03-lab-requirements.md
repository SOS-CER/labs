`PackScheduler` is a course registration system for a university, similar to the system in MyPackPortal that you use to register for your classes.  You'll work on implementing a system that provides the functionality for admitted students to register for courses that are taught by faculty.  The courses will have enrollment caps and waitlists.  

{% include iconHeader.html type="requirements" %}

For today's lab, you'll focus on the functionality related to the directory of students admitted to the university for study.

<font color="red">The update to the requirements for Lab 03 is that students must be stored in sorted order in the student directory.</font>

```

A student has a first name, last name, id, email address, password, and max number of credits they can take in a given semester. To protect the student's information, the student's password should be hashed using SHA-256 when stored.  Note that the hashed values may look different depending on what application you are using to view the input file. 

When stored in a text file, a student record is a comma separated list in the following format:

    firstName,lastName,id,email,hashedPassword,maxCredits
	
### Invalid Student Records

A student record is invalid in at least the following situations:

  * an item is missing
  * first name is null or an empty string
  * last name is null or an empty string
  * id is null or an empty string
  * email is null or an empty string
  * email doesn't contain an '@' character
  * email doesn't contain a '.' character
  * the index of the last '.' character in the email string is earlier than the index of the first '@' character (e.g., first.last@address would be invalid)
  * the password is null or an empty string
  * max credits is below 3 or above 18
