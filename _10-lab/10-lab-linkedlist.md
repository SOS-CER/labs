The design of the faculty directory functionality calls for a custom implementation of a linked list that doesn't allow for null elements or duplicate elements as defined by the `equals()` method.

{% include iconHeader.html type="implementation,unitTest" %}

You will use test driven development to implement the custom `LinkedList`.  Each section below describes the methods that you will be implementing.

`LinkedList` will inherit from `java.util.AbstractSequentialList`.  `AbstractSequentialList` provides functionality for all standard list methods by implementing them in terms of an `Iterator`.  However, the details about how the `Iterator` works is left to the author of the extending class - us!  For the methods that `LinkedList` inherits from `AbstractSequentialList` to work, we have to create `LinkedListIterator`, which implements the `ListIterator` interface.

Additionally, we need to provide some custom behavior to `LinkedList.add()` and `LinkedList.set()`.  The implementation of these methods from `AbstractSequentialList` allows duplicate values.  However, we don't want to allow duplicate values, so we need to override the functionality of `LinkedList.add()` and `LinkedList.set()` to check for duplicates.  If no duplicate is found, then we can delegate to the parent (i.e., `super.add()` and `super.set()`).


## Create `LinkedList` Class
Create `LinkedList` in the `src/` folder of the `edu.ncsu.csc216.pack_scheduler.util` package.  

`LinkedList` should extend `java.util.AbstractSequentialList` and should have a generic type parameter, `E`.


## Create `LinkedListTest` Class
Create `LinkedListTest` in the `test/` folder of the `edu.ncsu.csc216.pack_scheduler.util` package.  

Since the `LinkedListTest` expected functionality is identical to `ArrayList`'s functionality, you should start from the `ArrayList` tests.  Copy those into `LinkedListTest`. 

When testing, you should work with a list of `String`s.  Those will be easier to test that more complex objects like `Faculty`s.


## Implement `ListNode`
`ListNode` is an inner class of `LinkedList`.  Add the class after the last method but before closing the `LinkedList` curly brace.  The `ListNode` class header should look like the following:

    private class ListNode { ... }
    
Note that `ListNode`'s constructor has no generic type in this implementation.  `ListNode` will use `LinkedList`'s generic type.  

`ListNode` has three public fields.  Add the fields to the `ListNode` class:

  * `data`: type `E` - the data in the node
  * `next`: type `ListNode` - the next node in the list
  * `prev`: type `ListNode` - the previous node in the list
  
`ListNode` has two constructors.  Add the constructors to the `ListNode` class.  They should assign the parameter to the associated fields:

  * `ListNode(E data)`
  * `ListNode(E data, ListNode prev, ListNode next)`


## Create `LinkedListIterator`
`AbstractSequentialList` provides functionality for all standard list methods by implementing them in terms of an `Iterator`.  That means to create a concrete implementation of `AbstractSequentialList`, you need to [implement the `ListIterator` interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html).  Create an inner class named `LinkedListIterator` that implements the `ListIterator` interface.  The `LinkedListIterator` class header should look like the following:

    private class LinkedListIterator implements ListIterator<E> { ... }
    
`LinkedListIterator` has five fields:

  * `previous`: represents the `ListNode` that would be returned on a call to `previous()`
  * `next`: represents the `ListNode` that would be returned on a call to `next()`
  * `previousIndex`: the index that would be returned on a call to `previousIndex()`
  * `nextIndex`: the index that would be returned on a call to `nextIndex()`
  * `lastRetrieved`: represents the `ListNode` that was returned on the last call to either `previous()` or `next()` or null if a call to `previous()` or `next()` was not the last call on the `ListIterator`.

In addition to the eight methods from `ListIterator` that you must override (and will implement in the following steps), `LinkedListIterator` has a constructor that accepts an index to position the iterator.  For now, stub out the constructor.  You'll implement it later.

    public LinkedListIterator(int index) { 
       //TODO implement later
    }
    
The `LinkedListIterator` is an object that represents the current location of the `LinkedListIterator` in the `LinkedList`.  Because you are working with a doubly linked list, the `LinkedListIterator` can move forward or backward in the list during traversal.  That means that the current location of the `LinkedListIterator` is always between TWO `ListNode`s.  To simplify the implementation of the `LinkedListIterator` methods, the `LinkedList` class will always have two `ListNodes` with null data.  These nodes represent the idea of index -1 and index size in our list.  By having these null data `ListNode`s the `LinkedListIterator` is always between two `ListNode`s even when the `LinkedListIterator` is at the front of the list or back of the list.  The model is shown in the figure below.

## Implement `LinkedList` State
`LinkedList` has the following state:

  * `front`: a `ListNode`
  * `back`: a `ListNode`
  * `size`: the size of the list
  

## Implement `LinkedList.LinkedList()`
The constructor of `LinkedList` should initialize the state.  To fit the model where a `LinkedListIterator` should always be between two `ListNode`s, you need to create two `ListNode`s with null data that represent the idea of nodes that are out of bounds at indexes -1 and `size` so that your empty list looks like:

![*Empty List*](images/EmptyList.PNG)

That means the constructor of `LinkedList` should do the following:

  * Create a `ListNode` with `null` data that `front` points to.
  * Create a `ListNode` with `null` data that `back` points to.
  * Have `front`'s `next` point to `back`
  * Have `back`'s `prev` point to `front`
  * Initialize `size` to 0.


## Implement `LinkedList.size()`
One of the two abstract methods in `AbstractSequentialList` is `size()`.  Implement `size()` to return the `size` field.


## Implement `LinkedList.listIterator()`
The other abstract method in `AbstractSequentialList` is `listIterator()`.  The method returns a `ListIterator<E>` that is positioned such that a call to `ListIterator.next()` will return the element at given index ([as per the `AbstractSequentialList` API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/AbstractSequentialList.html).  All `LinkedList.listIterator()` does is construct a `LinkedListIterator` object.  When constructing the `LinkedListIterator` object, you don't need the generic type on the constructor because the generic type is handled by extending `ListIterator<E>`!


## Implement `LinkedListIterator.LinkedListIterator()`
The constructor for `LinkedListIterator` recieves an index for positioning the `LinkedListIterator` in the list.  That means the constructor needs to traverse to the appropriate location, which is between `index-1` and `index`.  That means you [satisfy the instructions in `AbstractSequentialList` that the value at `index` is what is returned on a call to `next()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/AbstractSequentialList.html).  To implement `LinkedIntListIterator()`, do the following:

  * Check the `index` to ensure that it's within bounds of the list.  If not, throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` that will propagate through the `LinkedList.listIteartor()` method.
  *  If the `index` is within bounds, iterate through the list so that the `previous` `ListNode` points to the `ListNode` at `index-1` and the `next` `ListNode` points to the `ListNode` at `index`.
  * Update the `previousIndex` and `nextIndex` fields.
  * `lastRetrieved` should be null.
  
By implementing the padding of a lead and trailing `ListNode` with `null` data, you  ensure that `previous` points to the `ListNode` with `null` data when the `LinkedListIterator` is at the front of the list and that `next` points to the `ListNode` with `null` data when the `LinkedListIterator` is at the end of the list. 


## Implement `LinkedListIterator.has*()` and `LinkedListIterator.*Index()` Methods
The `LinkedListIterator.has*()` method return true if there is a `next` or `previous` node in the list (i.e., a `ListNode` where the `data` is not null).  [Implement the `has*()` methods using the API for guidance](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html).

The `LinkedListIterator.*Index()` methods return the index of the `next` or `previous` node in the list.  [Implement the `*Index()` methods using the API for guidance](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html).

Start running your tests and ensure that the the tests that don't involve adding, removing, or setting pass.  


## Implement `LinkedListIterator.next()` and `LinkedListIterator.previous()` Methods
The `LinkedListIterator.next()` and `LinkedListIterator.previous()` methods return the element in the `next` or `previous` `ListNode`. If the `next` or `previous` `ListNode` has `null` `data`, you should throw a `NoSuchElementException`. Remember, the `next()` and `previous()` methods will move forward or backward through the list before returning the value but after retrieving the value to return.

The `next()` and `previous()` methods should set `lastRetrieved` to the `ListNode` that contains the returned value.  This will be used in the methods for modifying the list as a flag for if an operation can happen.

Run your tests to ensure no regressions.


## Implement `LinkedListIterator.add(E)`
Override and implement the `LinkedListIterator.add(E)` method.  As per the [`ListIterator` API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html), the `add()` method will insert the element before the element that would be returned by `next()`.  Don't forget to increment `size`. The API states:

    Inserts the specified element into the list (optional operation). The element is inserted immediately before the element that would be 
    returned by next(), if any, and after the element that would be returned by previous(), if any. (If the list contains no elements, the 
    new element becomes the sole element on the list.) The new element is inserted before the implicit cursor: a subsequent call to next 
    would be unaffected, and a subsequent call to previous would return the new element. (This call increases by one the value that would 
    be returned by a call to nextIndex or previousIndex.)
    
When implementing this method, do not allow null objects to be inserted.  Those are special values for our leading and trailing `ListNode`s.  If the element to add is null, the method should throw a `NullPointerException`.

After the `add()` method is done, `lastRetrieved` should be set to `null`.  `lastRetrieved` should only have a value after a call to `next()` or `previous()`.

After implementing `LinkedListIterator.add()`, your `LinkedList.add()` method should pass for everything except duplicate values and `LinkedList.get()` test should pass.


## Override `LinkedList.add(int, E)`
Checking for duplicate values in `LinkedListIterator.add()` isn't possible.  The `LinkedListIterator` is already in position to add.  Therefore, you have to override `LinkedList.add(int, E)` to add a check for a duplicate value.  

Put your cursor in the editor between the `LinkedList.size()` and `LinkedList.listIterator()` methods.  Then right click and select **Source > Override/Implement Methods**.  Select `AbstractSequentialList<E>.add(int, E)`.  

If the element to add is a duplicate of an element already in the list as determined by the `LinkedList.contains()` method, the method should throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.  

After overriding and implementing `LinkedList.add(int, E)`, make sure your `LinkedList.add()` method passes.


## Implement `LinkedListIterator.set(E)`
Override and implement the `LinkedListIterator.set(E)` method.  As per the [`ListIterator` API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html), the `set()` method will modify the element returned by the last call to `previous()` or `next()`.  The API states: 

    Replaces the last element returned by next() or previous() with the specified element (optional operation). This call can be made 
    only if neither remove() nor add(E) have been called after the last call to next or previous.

If `lastRetrieved` is `null`, meaning that `remove()` or `add(E)` was the last call on the list or there has not been a call to `next()` or `previous()`, an `IllegalStateException` should be thrown.

When implementing this method, do not allow `null` objects to be set.  Those are special values for the leading and trailing `ListNode`s.  If the element to set is `null`, the method should throw a `NullPointerException`.

After implementing `LinkedListIterator.set()`, your `LinkedList.set()` method should pass for everything except duplicate values.


## Override `LinkedList.set(int, E)`
Checking for duplicate values in `LinkedListIterator.set()` isn't possible.  The `LinkedListIterator` is already in position to set.  Therefore, you must override `LinkedList.set(int, E)` to add a check for a duplicate value.  

Put your cursor in the editor between the `LinkedList.size()` and `LinkedList.listIterator()` methods.  Then right click and select **Source > Override/Implement Methods**.  Select `AbstractSequentialList<E>.set(int, E)`.  

If the element to set is a duplicate of an element already in the list as determined by the `LinkedList.contains()` method, the method should throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.  

After overriding and implementing `LinkedList.set(int, E)`, make sure your `LinkedList.set()` tests pass.


## Implement `LinkedListIterator.remove()`
Override and implement the `LinkedListIterator.remove()` method.  As per the [`ListIterator` API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html), the `remove()` method will remove the element returned by the last call to `previous()` or `next()`.  The API states: 

    Removes from the list the last element that was returned by next() or previous() (optional operation). This call can only be made 
    once per call to next or previous. It can be made only if add(E) has not been called after the last call to next or previous.
    
If `lastRetrieved` is `null`, meaning that `remove()` or `add(E)` was the last call on the list or there has not been a call to `next()` or `previous()`, an `IllegalStateException` should be thrown.

Otherwise, remove the `lastRetrieved` `ListNode` and decrement the `size`.

After you finish implementing `LinkedListIterator.remove()`, all tests should pass! If not, debug your implementation.

## Javadoc your Code
Javadoc the `LinkedList` class, state, and methods.  For overridden methods remove the green comments and Javadoc them to describe how the methods work in `LinkedList`.  Do NOT delete the `@Override` annotation.

Run [CheckStyle](../../gp1/gp1-static-analysis#checkstyle) to ensure that your Javadoc has all elements.
