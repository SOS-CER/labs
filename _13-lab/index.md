# CSC216 Lab 13 - Non-linear Data Structures
You have finished `WolfScheduler`!  Your managers are interested in adding a prerequisite check to a future version of the system so that students cannot enroll in a course unless they meet the prerequisite.  Prerequisite checks can be modeled as a tree.  To learn more about trees, your managers want you to explore binary search trees!


{% capture callout_content %}
  * Explore binary search trees
  * Present a design
  * Calculate runtime efficiency

## Lab Deadlines
There is no automatic evaluation for Lab 13.  

On-campus students will **complete Lab 13 during their lab period**.  

DE students have [their own version of this assignment](https://courses.ncsu.edu/csc216/lec/601/wrap/projects/Lab13.html).  The DE grading rubric is described in the DE version of the assignment.


## Lab 13 Rubric
You will be evaluated on the following items for Lab 13.  

|Rubric Item|Points|Description|
|:---|:----------|----------:|:------------------------------------------------------|
|In-Lab Participation|15|PTFs will be looking for collaboration with your team during the lab activity.  Additionally, PTFs will be observing you during presentations - you should be paying attention to your peers as they present!  DE students will earn these points by completing the lab activity|
|Introductions|10|Each team member introduces themselves to the lab.  DE students will earn these points through appropriate naming of their submission.|
|Presentation|15|Each team member has a significant contribution to the presentation. DE students will earn these points through a well-formatted document.|
|Organization|15|The presentation is well-organized and logical.  The presentation length is appropriate.|
|Counting Shapes|15|The algorithm for counting shapes is reasonable and could solve the problem.|
|Error Conditions|15|All error conditions are handled.|
|Runtime|15|The discussion on the algorithm runtime is appropriate for the described algorithm and would solve the problem in less than 5 seconds.|
|**Total**|**100**| |
