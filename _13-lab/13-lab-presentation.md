# CSC216 Lab 13 Presentation
You will present your design.  As part of the presentation, you will address the following:

  * How you will identify and count the different tree shapes from an input file.
  * How you will handle error conditions.
  * An estimation of the runtime of your algorithm.
  
The audience of your presentation is your manager.  You want to demonstrate your technical understanding of binary search trees and convince your manager that you have created an efficient algorithm to solve the counting problem.
  
 
## On-Campus Presentation Process
You will present your team's design to your lab.  
  
You will be evaluated on your presentation by your lab PTF and you will receive feedback about your presentation from your peers.

During your five minute presentation, each member of the team will be expected to present.  

For the presentation, you may use the whiteboard, power point slides, paper on the document camera, or just talk through your algorithm.

When your peers are presenting, you will fill out a [feedback form about the strengths of their presentation and areas of improvement](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNPM9gTkkDepFSbDxWn_XTFmahQaBv7rycadisV7Y0tFDYDQ/viewform). Feedback will be distributed via email after the lab is complete.


 
## Lab Deadlines
There is no automatic evaluation for Lab 13.  

On-campus students will **complete Lab 13 during their lab period**.  


## Lab 13 Rubric

|Rubric Item|Points|Description|
|:----------|----------:|:------------------------------------------------------|
|In-Lab Participation|15|PTFs will be looking for collaboration with your team during the lab activity.  Additionally, PTFs will be observing you during presentations - you should be paying attention to your peers as they present!  DE students will earn these points by completing the lab activity|
|Introductions|10|Each team member introduces themselves to the lab.  DE students will earn these points through appropriate naming of their submission.|
|Presentation|15|Each team member has a significant contribution to the presentation. DE students will earn these points through a well-formatted document.|
|Organization|15|The presentation is well-organized and logical.  The presentation length is appropriate.|
|Counting Shapes|15|The algorithm for counting shapes is reasonable and could solve the problem.|
|Error Conditions|15|All error conditions are handled.|
|Runtime|15|The discussion on the algorithm runtime is appropriate for the described algorithm and would solve the problem in less than 5 seconds.|
|**Total**|**100**| |
