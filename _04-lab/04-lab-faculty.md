description: Designing `PackScheduler` Faculty Functionality
navigation: on
pagegroup: 04-lab
---

Now that you have compared two designs and integrated two systems to meet a provided design, you should propose your own design for the faculty functionality.

{% include iconHeader.html type="design" %}


## Creating your Design
Using the [extended requirements below](#faculty-requirements), [current requirements](04-lab-requirements), and the candidate designs from Part 1, you will extend the one of the designs to include the faculty functionality discussed below.

**Updated or New Requirements**

  * **PackScheduler**
     * [Use Case 0: Start PackScheduler](#uc0)
	 
  * **Faculty Directory**
     * [Use Case 18: Create Faculty Directory](#uc18)
     * [Use Case 19: Load Faculty Directory](#uc19)
     * [Use Case 20: Save Faculty Directory](#uc20)
     * [Use Case 21: Add Faculty to Faculty Directory](#uc21)
     * [Use Case 22: Remove Faculty from Faculty Directory](#uc22)
	 
  * **Faculty Scheduling**
     * [Use Case 23: View Faculty Schedule](#uc23)


We have provided an UXF class diagram file that can be used by the [web application UMLetino](http://www.umlet.com/umletino/umletino.html). Select **File Import** and select an UXF file.

  * [Candidate Design A](images/DesignA.uxf)
  * [Candidate Design B](images/DesignB.uxf)
  
Another diagramming tool option is [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/), but you'll have to create the design from scratch.
  
## Submitting your Design
<!--For Dia, export the finished design as a *.png file by selecting **File > Export**.  Under **Export Options** select **PNG (anti-aliased)(*.png)**.-->

For UMLetino, select the **File Export** option. There are options to **Save Diagram File** and **Same Image File**. Save both.

Save your class diagram files to the `project_docs/` folder in your `PackScheduler` project.  Make sure that these files are pushed to GitHub for grading!

## Data Format

### Faculty Records

Faculty records can be saved and loaded from a file in the correct format.  An example of a valid file would be: 

```

Lacey,Walls,lwalls,nascetur.ridiculus.mus@fermentum.net,0ÉRú±"ÃùuŸ¦Ù\7X²F´þâ9•{-OîFâapÄ,2
```

A faculty record has a first name, last name, id, email address, password, and max number of courses they can teach in a given semester. To protect the faculty's information, the faculty's password should be hashed using SHA-256 when stored.  

When stored in a text file, a faculty record is a comma separated list in the following format:

    firstName,lastName,id,email,hashedPassword,maxCourses
	
### Invalid Faculty Records

A faculty record is invalid in at least the following situations:

  * an item is missing
  * first name is null or an empty string
  * last name is null or an empty string
  * id is null or an empty string
  * email is null or an empty string
  * email doesn't contain an '@' character
  * email doesn't contain a '.' character
  * the index of the last '.' character in the email string is smaller than the index of the first '@' character (e.g., first.last@address would be invalid)
  * the password is null or an empty string
  * max courses is under 0 or above 3
