## Lab Rubric
{% include iconHeader.html type="rubric" %}

You will be evaluated out of 70 points in the [Technical Rubric](#technical-rubric).  Synchronous students will also be [evaluated on their teaming](#synchronous-collaboration-rubric): a combination of In-Lab Participation and Out-Lab Participation.  Collaborating Asynchronous students will also be [evaluated on their participation in their pair](#asynchronous-collaboration-rubric).  

Pair/teams are expected to work together on all aspects of the lab activity.  Points may be deducted for not contributing or for not providing a partner the opportunity to contribute.  The teaching staff strongly encourages working synchronously and **requires** that these collaborative sessions are documented in GitHub commit messages for the teaching staff to note the team contribution.
