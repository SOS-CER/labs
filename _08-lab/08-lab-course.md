# CSC 217 Lab 08 Integrate into `Course` and Related Classes
{% include iconHeader.html type="implementation,unitTest" %}
Now that the `CourseRoll` is complete, the `Course` class should use it keep track of a `Course`'s roll.  This will require the use of a new parameter when constructing `Course`: `enrollmentCap`.  Additionally, the `enrollmentCap` should be stored with a course record.  That means an update to `CourseRecordIO`, `CourseCatalog`, and the associated test files to add the enrollment capacity value.  


## Integrate `CourseRoll` into `Course`
Follow the [provided design](08-lab-design) to integrate `CourseRoll` into the `Course` class.  You'll add the parameter, `roll` and the method `getCourseRoll()`.

You should construct the `CourseRoll` in the `Course` constructor(s).  This will require a new parameter, `enrollmentCap`, which should follow the `instructorId` parameter.  For the moment, this will break `CourseRecordIO`, `CourseCatalog`, and various tests.  Work through the changes carefully as outlined below.

Additionally, update or add the following methods in `Course`:
  
  * Update `Course.toString()` to include the `enrollmentCap` from `roll` after the `instructorId` in the comma separate value string.
  * Update `Course.getShortDisplayArray()` to include a 5th element (index 4) containing the open seats in the `Course`'s `CourseRoll`.
  * Add the `getCourseRoll()` method.  It should return a `CourseRoll` object.
  

Once `Course` compiles, update your test cases to include a value for the `enrollmentCap` parameter.  You'll need to change all test files that construct a `Course` object to use an `enrollmentCap`.

You should also add test cases for:

  * Ensuring a correct `enrollmentCap` or that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown if the `enrollmentCap` is out of bounds as described in the [requirements](08-lab-requirements#uc6).
  * Ensuring that you updates to the `toString()` method is correct.
  * Ensuring that the `getShortDisplayArray()` is now returning an array of length 5 and the contents are correct.


Run your `Course` tests in isolation.  Once they compile, and you update as described above, they should pass with no regressions.


## Update `CourseRecordIO` and `CourseRecordIOTest`
Now that there is an enrollment cap, you should update your test files for `CourseRecordIO`. Download new copies of the `CourseRecordIOTest` files:

  * [course_records.txt](files/course_records.txt)
  * [expected_course_records.txt](files/expected_course_records.txt)
  * [starter_course_records.txt](files/starter_course_records.txt)
  
Update the `CourseRecordIO.readCourse()` method to handle the `enrollmentCap` in a line of input.  You may also need to update `CourseRecordIOTest` if you have any calls to the `Course` constructor.

Once `CourseRecordIO` and `CourseRecordIOTest` compile, run `CourseRecordIOTest` in isolation.  The tests should pass with no regressions.


## Update `CourseCatalog` and `CourseCatalogTest`
`CourseCatalog` and `CourseCatalogTest` also require updates.  

  * Add an `enrollmentCap` parameter after the `instructorId` parameter and update the call to the `Course` constructor in `CourseCatalog`.
  * Update `getCourseCatalog()` to return a 5th column with the number of remaining seats.  If you already delegate to `Course.getShortDisplayArray()`, no change will be needed unless you hardcoded the columns in the array to 4.  If you do not delegate to `Course.getShortDisplayArray()`, you should do so!  


`CourseCatalogTest` should change all calls to the `Course` constructor to add an enrollment cap.  Update your tests accordingly.  You may need to change your expected results file:

  * [expected_course_catalog.txt](files/expected_course_catalog.txt)
  

## Fix Other Compiler Errors
Change the CourseCatalogPanel GUI file to remove any additional compiler errors related to the `Course` and `enrollmentCap` functionality.   

  * [`CourseCatalogPanel` Code](files/CourseCatalogPanel.java)
  
Update any additional tests, like `RegistrationManagerTest`, that need the enrollment capacity.  

Make sure that all code is compiling and all tests are passing before moving on.
