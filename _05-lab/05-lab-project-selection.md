# CSC 217 Lab 05: Teams ONLY 
Lab 05 is the first of three team rotations that will occur in CSC 217 labs this semester.  We rotate teams for several reasons, but the most important is so that you gain more experience working with a wider variety of students in CSC 217.  


## Select Project
Each team member will be coming into this lab with their own project!  As a team, you'll need to select one project to move forward with. Discuss which project is the best starting point for moving forward. 


## Push Selected Project into GitHub
You have been assigned a new GitHub repository for the second team rotation: csc217-LL-XXX-Y, where XXX is your lab section number and Y is your team number (LL represents the second lab rotation).  

The owner of the selected team project will need to follow the process used in [Guided Project 2](https://pages.github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc216/guided-projects/gp2/gp2-repo.html) and [Guided Project 3](https://pages.github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc216/guided-projects/gp3/gp3-repo.html) for disconnecting a project from an existing repository and sharing it to a new repository.

Run all tests to ensure no regressions.


## Set Up Static Analysis Tools
Set up your project to automatically run SpotBug, PMD, and Checkstyle if the project isn't already set up for static analysis.


## Teammates Pull Selected Project from GitHub
Once the `PackScheduler` project is pushed to the new `LL` repo, the other team members should clone the repo and import the `PackScheduler` project into their workspace (you'll need to close and delete any existing `PackScheduler` project - you can delete a project from your workspace without deleting it from your file system!).
