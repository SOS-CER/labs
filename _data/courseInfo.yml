    semester: Fall 2021
    shortName: CSC 217
    name: Software Development Fundamentals Lab
    description: Laboratory course to accompany CSC 216 lecture course. Application of the software processes and practices to design, implement, and test the development of software solutions requiring composition; inheritance; finite state machines; and linear data structures, including recursive linked lists.
    prerequisites:
      - CSC 116 with a C or better
    corequisites:
      - CSC 216
    outcomes:
      - Design, implement, and test programs which use object-oriented language features of inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism;
      - Employ the phases of the software development life cycle (requirements, design, implementation, and test) in developing software;
      - Use UML class diagrams to propose a design to satisfy requirements;
      - Use design patterns (e.g., model-view-controller and the state pattern) to solve development problems;
      - Design effective system and unit tests and implement automated unit test code;
      - Navigate and extract information from the Java API, and employ the Javadoc tool to construct internal documentation of source code;
      - Use software engineering best practices like pair programming, test-driven development, code coverage, static analysis, version control, continuous integration, and documentation with supporting tooling to design, implement, and test object-oriented systems.
      - Design, implement, and test a finite state machine;
      - Design, implement, and test simple recursive data structures;
      - Implement, test, and use a stack, queue, array-based list, and linked list.
