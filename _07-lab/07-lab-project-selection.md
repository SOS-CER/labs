# CSC216 Lab 07: DE Pairs ONLY: Project Selection
Lab 07 is the first lab where DE students may choose to work in pairs.  For those who selected to work in pairs, you will need to coordinate with your partner to complete the following steps. 


## Select Project
Each team member will be coming into lab with their own project!  As a team, you'll need to select one project to move forward with. Discuss which project is the best starting point for moving forward. 


## Push Selected Project into GitHub
DE pairs have been assigned a new GitHub repository for their team: csc216-701-LL-YY, where YY is your team number (LL represents pairs for DE).  

The owner of the selected team project will need to follow the process used in [Guided Project 2](../../gp2/gp2-repo) and [Guided Project 3](../../gp3/gp3-repo) for disconnecting a project from an existing repository and sharing it to a new repository.

Run all tests to ensure no regressions.


## Set Up Static Analysis Tools
Set up your project to automatically run FindBugs, PMD, and Checkstyle if the project isn't already set up for static analysis.


## Teammates Pull Selected Project from GitHub
The other team member should remove their copy of `PackScheduler` from their workspace or start using a new workspace.  To remove a project, right click on the project and select **Delete Project**.  Do not select any options that delete the project on the file system.  You want to keep a copy of your old project on the file system.  The **Delete Project** action removes the project from the Eclipse workspace so you can import your partner's project.

Once the `PackScheduler` project is pushed to the new `LL` repo, the other team member should clone the new `LL` repo and import the `PackScheduler` project into their workspace.
