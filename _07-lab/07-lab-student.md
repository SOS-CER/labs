# CSC 217 Lab 06 Integrate into `Student`
{% include iconHeader.html type="implementation,unitTest" %}
Now that the `Schedule` is complete, the `Student` class should use it keep track of a `Student`'s schedule.  


## Integrate `Schedule` into `Student`
Follow the [provided design](07-lab-design) to integrate `Schedule` into the `Student` class.

The introduction of the new schedule functionality shouldn't lead to the regression of any existing tests.  If you do run into any issues, determine if you need to update the tests to meet the new requirements OR if there is a bug in your new code.
